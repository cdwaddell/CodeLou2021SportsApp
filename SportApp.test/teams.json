The stadium is adjacent to the Gila River Arena and it features the first fully retractable natural grass playing surface built in the United States on top of an AirField Systems drainage system. An opening on one side of the stadium allows the playing field to move to the exterior of the building, allowing the entire natural turf playing surface to be exposed to daylight and also allowing the floor of the stadium to be used for any other purpose (such as seating for concerts) without damaging the turf.\r\n\r\nThe stadium has hosted the Fiesta Bowl, the 2007 BCS National Championship Game, Super Bowl XLII, and the 2011 BCS National Championship Game, a game that it hosted every four years, which set the venue\u0027s entertainment attendance record of 78,603 on January 11, 2011. It will host the Pro Bowl, Super Bowl XLIX and CONCACAF Gold Cup matches in 2015, and the NCAA Final Four in 2017.\r\n\r\nThe University of Phoenix acquired the naming rights in September 2006, shortly after the stadium had opened under the name Cardinals Stadium.

They currently are members of the West division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Cardinals were founded in 1898, and are the oldest continuously run professional sports team in the United States outside of baseball.\r\n\r\nThe team was established in Chicago in 1898 and was a charter member of the NFL in 1920. Along with the Chicago Bears, the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in operation since the league\u0027s founding. (The Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). The club then moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1960 and played in that city through 1987 (sometimes referred to as the \u0022Football Cardinals\u0022 and/or the \u0022Big Red\u0022 to avoid confusion with the Major League Baseball St. Louis Cardinals). Other less commonly used nicknames were the \u0022Gridbirds\u0022 (used only by a local newspaper columnist) or \u0022Cardiac Cards\u0022 (used only to refer to the 1975 team). Before the 1988 NFL season, the team moved to Tempe, Arizona, a college suburb east of Phoenix, and played their home games for the next 18 years at Arizona State University\u0027s Sun Devil Stadium. In 2006, the club began playing all home games at the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium in the northwestern suburb of Glendale, although the team\u0027s training facility is in Tempe.\r\n\r\nThe franchise has two NFL championships, both while it was based in Chicago. The first occurred in 1925, but is the subject of controversy, with supporters of the Pottsville Maroons believing that Pottsville should have gotten the title. Their second title, and the first to be received through a championship game, came in 1947, two decades before the first Super Bowl game was played.\r\n\r\nIn the six-plus decades since winning the championship in 1947, the team suffered many losing seasons, and currently hold the league\u0027s longest active championship drought. They have been to the playoffs six times and have won six playoff games, three of which were victories during their run in the 2008\u201309 NFL Playoffs. During that season, they won their only NFC Championship Game since the 1970 AFL-NFL Merger, and reached Super Bowl XLIII. The team has also won four division titles (1974, 1975, 2008, and 2009) since their 1947\u20131948 NFL championship game appearances.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 the Cardinals became the first NFL franchise to lose 700 games since its inception. The franchise\u0027s all-time mark at the conclusion of the 2013 season is 511\u2013716\u201339.\r\n\r\nFrom 1988 through 2012 (except 2005, when they trained in Prescott), the Cardinals conducted their annual summer training camp at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The Cardinals moved their training camp to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2013.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":"O Arizona Cardinals (tamb\u00E9m chamado de Cards) \u00E9 um time de futebol americano da cidade de Glendale, Arizona que disputa a divis\u00E3o oeste da Confer\u00EAncia Nacional da NFL.\r\n\r\nFoi fundado em 1898 em Chicago, \u00E9 a mais antiga franquia de futebol americano, tendo sido um dos fundadores da NFL em 1920.

Despite success within the NFL, they could not survive in Portsmouth, then the NFL\u0027s smallest city. The team was purchased and relocated to Detroit for the 1934 season.\r\n\r\nThe Lions have won four NFL championships, tied for 9th overall in total championships amongst all 32 NFL franchises; however, their last was in 1957, which gives the club the second-longest NFL championship drought behind the Arizona Cardinals. They are one of four current teams and the only NFC team to have not yet played in the Super Bowl.\r\n\r\nThe Lions have been a part of multiple divisions and have had several division rivals in their existence. Their oldest rivals are the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers, whom they have been paired with in a division since 1933. The Minnesota Vikings have been in a division with Detroit ever since their inaugural season in 1961. Other notable longtime division opponents were the Cleveland/Los Angeles Rams (29 seasons from 1937\u20131966, except for 1943), the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (25 seasons from 1977\u20132001), the San Francisco 49ers (17 seasons from 1950\u20131966), the Chicago Cardinals (16 seasons from 1933\u20131949, except for 1944), and the Baltimore Colts (14 seasons from 1953\u20131966).\r\n\r\nThe Lions also have a preseason rivalry with the Cleveland Browns, dubbed the Great Lakes Classic. The two teams have been playing for The Barge Trophy since 2002.

Informally known as New City Stadium for its first eight seasons, it was renamed in August 1965 in memory of Packers founder, player, and long-time head coach, Curly Lambeau, who had died two months earlier.\r\n\r\nThe stadium\u0027s street address has been 1265 Lombardi Avenue since August 1968, when Highland Avenue was renamed in honor of former head coach Vince Lombardi. It sits on a block bounded by Lombardi Avenue (north); Oneida Street (east); Stadium Drive and Valley View Road (south); and Ridge Road (west). The playing field at the stadium has a conventional north-south alignment, at an elevation of 640 feet (195 m) above sea level.\r\n\r\nThe stadium completed its latest renovation in the summer of 2013 with the addition of 7,000 seats high in the south end zone. About 5,400 of the new seating is general, while the remaining 1,600 seats are club or terrace suite seating. With a capacity of 81,441, Lambeau Field is the third-largest stadium in the NFL with standing room, but is second in normal capacity. It is now the largest venue in the state, edging out Camp Randall Stadium (80,321) at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.\r\n\r\nLambeau Field is the oldest continually operating NFL stadium. In 2007, the Packers completed their 51st season at Lambeau, breaking the all-time NFL record set by the Chicago Bears at Wrigley Field (1921\u201370). (While Soldier Field in Chicago is older, it was not the home of the Bears until 1971.) Only the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley have longer active home-field tenures in American professional sports.","strStadiumLocation":"Green Bay, Wisconsin","intStadiumCapacity":"80735","strWebsite":"www.packers.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com/Packers","strTwitter":"twitter.com/packers","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com/packers/?hl=en","strDescriptionEN":"The Green Bay Packers is a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league\u0027s National Football Conference (NFC) North division. It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, dating back to 1919, and is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States. Home games have been played at Lambeau Field since 1957.\r\n\r\nThe Packers is the last of the \u0022small town teams\u0022 which were common in the NFL during the 1920s and 30s. Founded in 1919 by Earl \u0022Curly\u0022 Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today\u0027s NFL, in 1921. Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America, its local fan and media base extends 120 miles south into Milwaukee, where it played selected home games between 1933 and 1994. And despite its small market, Forbes ranked the Packers as the world\u0027s 26th most valuable sports franchise in 2016, with a value of $2.35 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles in addition to four Super Bowl victories. The Packers won the first two Super Bowls in 1967 and 1968 and were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) prior to the AFL\u2013NFL merger. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is named after the Packers\u0027 coach Lombardi, who guided them to their first two Super Bowls. Their two additional Super Bowl wins came in 1997 and 2011.\r\n\r\nThe Packers are long-standing adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who today comprise the NFL\u0027s NFC North division, and were formerly members of the NFC Central Division. The Bears\u2013Packers rivalry is one of the oldest in NFL history, dating back to 1921.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"United States","strTeamBadge":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/rqpwtr1421434717.png","strTeamJersey":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/jersey/twurqp1471815616.png","strTeamLogo":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/logo/5mfles1512747240.png","strTeamFanart1":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/uwttqw1423146157.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/rs62a31548378766.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/rtstxq1423146287.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/k8i4rh1548382513.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/banner/qsvxpt1421524845.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQNxN374__FJoD88a7kGzQ","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134926","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Houston Texans","strTeamShort":"HOU","strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"2002","strSport":"American Football","strLeague":"NFL","idLeague":"4391","strLeague2":null,"idLeague2":null,"strLeague3":null,"idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":null,"idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":null,"idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"Bill O\u0027Brien","strStadium":"NRG Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"NRG Stadium (formerly Reliant Stadium) is a multi-purpose stadium, in Houston, Texas, USA.

The stadium was constructed to allow the removal of the RCA Dome and expansion of the Indiana Convention Center on its site. The stadium is on the south side of South Street, the block south of the site of the former RCA Dome. The stadium is often referred to as \u0022The House That Manning Built\u0022, even though Peyton Manning no longer plays for the Indianapolis Colts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to serving as a football stadium, the Lucas Oil Stadium is also the well-known site for two famous music competitions in the United States; the Bands of America Grand National Championships, which feature some of the highest achieving high school marching bands; and the Drum Corps International Championships. Both organizations serve corps style bands.\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 2006, prior to the construction of the stadium, Forrest Lucas announced that Lucas Oil had purchased the naming rights for $121 million over 20 years.\r\n\r\nThe architectural firm HKS, Inc. was responsible for the stadium\u2019s design, with Walter P Moore working as the Structural Engineer of Record. The stadium features a retractable roof and window wall, thus allowing the Colts to play both indoors and outdoors.

The Raiders compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league\u0027s American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The Raiders will play their home games at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, in 2020.\r\n\r\nFounded on January 30, 1960, and originally based in Oakland, California, they played their first regular season game on September 11, 1960, as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). They moved to the NFL with the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. The team departed Oakland to play in Los Angeles from the 1982 season through the 1994 season before returning to Oakland at the start of the 1995 season. On March 27, 2017, NFL team owners voted nearly unanimously to approve the Raiders\u0027 application to relocate to Las Vegas. Nearly three years later, on January 22, 2020, the Raiders officially moved to Las Vegas.\r\n\r\nThe Raiders\u0027 off-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years. The team\u0027s first three years of operation (1960\u20131962) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In 1963, however, the Raiders\u0027 fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) Al Davis. In 1967, after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) AFL Championship that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to Super Bowl II, where they were soundly defeated by the Green Bay Packers. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships (1976, 1980, 1983, and 2002), 1 AFL Championship (1967), and 3 Super Bowl Championships (XI, XV, and XVIII). At the end of the NFL\u0027s 2019 season, the Raiders have an all-time regular season record of 473 wins, 432 losses, and 11 ties; their all-time playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 19 losses.\r\n\r\nAl Davis owned the team from 1972 until his death in 2011. Control of the franchise was then given to Al\u0027s son Mark Davis, with Al\u0027s wife Carol maintaining ownership. The Raiders are known for their extensive fan base and distinctive team culture. The Raiders have 14 former members who have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. They have previously played at Kezar Stadium and Candlestick Park in San Francisco, Frank Youell Field and Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"United States","strTeamBadge":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/xqusqy1421724291.png","strTeamJersey":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/jersey/2017-134932-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/logo/6f8ezj1600553153.png","strTeamFanart1":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/9yztgo1552921320.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/vkhft51552921334.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/n400eb1552921346.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/1ise071552921361.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/banner/vrqqsv1421524556.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com/channel/UC1es5fp8FEK1L0EgHjCvmtQ","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135908","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":null,"intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Los Angeles Chargers","strTeamShort":"LAC","strAlternate":"The Bolts","intFormedYear":"1960","strSport":"American Football","strLeague":"NFL","idLeague":"4391","strLeague2":null,"idLeague2":null,"strLeague3":null,"idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":null,"idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":null,"idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"Anthony Lynn","strStadium":"Dignity Health Sports Park","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/stadium/qsursx1421813869.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Qualcomm Stadium (formerly San Diego Stadium and San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium; a.k.a. \u0022The Q\u0022 and \u0022The Murph\u0022) is a multi-purpose stadium, in San Diego, California, in the Mission Valley area.

Until 2003, it served as the home of the MLB\u0027s San Diego Padres.\r\n\r\nThe stadium has hosted three Super Bowl games: Super Bowl XXII in 1988, Super Bowl XXXII in 1998, and Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003. It has also hosted the 1978 and 1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Games, the 1996 and 1998 National League Division Series, the 1984 and 1998 National League Championship Series, and the 1984 and 1998 World Series. It is the only stadium ever to host both the Super Bowl and the World Series in the same year (1998). It is one of three stadiums to host the World Series, MLB All-Star Game, and Super Bowl, joining the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis (1987 World Series, 1991 World Series, Super Bowl XXVI, and 1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game) and Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (1959 World Series, the second All-Star Game in 1959, and Super Bowls I and VII).\r\n\r\nThe stadium is located immediately northwest of the interchange of Interstate 8 and Interstate 15. The neighborhood surrounding the stadium is known as Mission Valley, in reference to the Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00E1, which is located to the east, and its placement in the valley of the San Diego River. The stadium is served by the Qualcomm Stadium San Diego Trolley station, accessible via the Green Line running toward Downtown San Diego to the west, and Santee to the east.","strStadiumLocation":"Carson, California","intStadiumCapacity":"70561","strWebsite":"www.chargers.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com/chargers","strTwitter":"twitter.com/chargers","strInstagram":"instagram.com/chargers","strDescriptionEN":"The San Diego Chargers are a professional American football team based in San Diego, California.

The stadium serves as the home to the University of Southern California (USC) Trojans football team, and as the temporary home for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). The Coliseum was home to the Rams from 1946 to 1979, when they moved to Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California, and is serving as their home stadium again until the completion of Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California. The facility has a permanent seating capacity of 93,607 for USC football games, making it the largest football stadium in the Pac-12 Conference. For Rams games, capacity is at 80,000, giving it the fourth-largest capacity in the NFL.\r\n\r\nThe stadium is located in Exposition Park and across the street from USC. The Coliseum is jointly owned by the state of California, Los Angeles County, and the city of Los Angeles and managed and operated by the Auxiliary Services Department of the University of Southern California. From 1959 to 2016, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena was located adjacent to the Coliseum; the Sports Arena was closed in March 2016 and demolished between August and October 2016. Banc of California Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium and future home of Major League Soccer expansion club Los Angeles FC, is currently under construction on the former Sports Arena site and is scheduled to open in March 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Coliseum is the first stadium to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, in 1932 and 1984 and has been proposed to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The stadium was the temporary home of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball from 1958 to 1961 and was the host venue for games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1959 World Series. It was the site of the First AFL-NFL World Championship Game, later called Super Bowl I, and Super Bowl VII. Additionally, it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the Los Angeles Raiders of the NFL, and UCLA Bruins football. It was declared a National Historic Landmark on July 27, 1984, the day before the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which consists of three voting members appointed by the three ownership interests and meets on a quarterly basis, provides public oversight of the master lease agreement with USC. Under the lease the University has day-to-day management and operation responsibility for both the Coliseum and Sports Arena. The 98-year lease took effect on July 29, 2013, and was signed by the parties on September 5, 2013. The agreement requires the University to make approximately $100 million in physical improvements to the Coliseum, pay $1 million each year rent to the State of California, maintain the Coliseum\u0027s physical condition at the same standard used on the USC Campus, and assume all financial obligations for the operations and maintenance of the Coliseum and Sports Arena Complex.","strStadiumLocation":"Los Angeles, California","intStadiumCapacity":"90000","strWebsite":"www.therams.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com/Rams","strTwitter":"twitter.com/RamsNFL","strInstagram":"instagram.com/rams","strDescriptionEN":"The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team based in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

The Dolphins are a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division in the National Football League (NFL). The Dolphins play their home games at Sun Life Stadium in the northern suburb of Miami Gardens, and have their headquarters in Davie, Florida. The Dolphins and the Atlanta Falcons (who also began play in 1966) are the oldest NFL franchises in the Deep South, and Miami is the oldest AFC team in that region.\r\n\r\nThe Dolphins team was founded by attorney/politician Joe Robbie and actor/comedian Danny Thomas. They began play in the American Football League in 1966. The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the Miami Seahawks, who played in the All-America Football Conference in 1946 before becoming the first incarnation of the Baltimore Colts. For the first few years the Dolphins full-time training camp and practice facilities were at Saint Andrew\u0027s School, a private boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. In 1970 the Dolphins joined the NFL when the AFL\u2013NFL merger occurred.\r\n\r\nThe team made its first Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl VI, but lost to the Dallas Cowboys 24\u20133. In 1972, the Dolphins completed the NFL\u0027s only perfect season culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of its regular-season games, both of its NFL playoff games, and also Super Bowl VII. The Dolphins thus became the first NFL team to accomplish a perfect regular season. The Dolphins also won Super Bowl VIII, becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX, losing both games.\r\n\r\nFor most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by Don Shula, the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. His Dolphins teams posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback Dan Marino became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. He led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the 1999 season.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"United States","strTeamBadge":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/trtusv1421435081.png","strTeamJersey":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/jersey/jemev91486815347.png","strTeamLogo":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/logo/wn0jpj1552929016.png","strTeamFanart1":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/hd92tn1548536669.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/b36vy71548536742.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/oujh8p1548536756.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/z1bj461548536769.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/banner/qpvupy1421524207.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com/channel/UCHUSfEzpSRkUUsRkk_aJwDw","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134941","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":"1","strTeam":"Minnesota Vikings","strTeamShort":"MIN","strAlternate":"Vikings","intFormedYear":"1961","strSport":"American Football","strLeague":"NFL","idLeague":"4391","strLeague2":null,"idLeague2":null,"strLeague3":null,"idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":null,"idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":null,"idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"Mike Zimmer","strStadium":"U.S. Bank Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"https://www.vikings.com/rss/news","strStadiumThumb":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/stadium/qqypss1421611527.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"U.S. Bank Stadium is an enclosed stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.

In 2012, it also became the home stadium for the football program of the University of Massachusetts (UMass), making it the largest football stadium in the Mid-American Conference. The facility opened in 2002, replacing the old Foxboro Stadium. The seating capacity is 68,756, including 6,000 club seats and 87 luxury suites. The stadium is owned and operated by Kraft Sports Group, a subsidiary of The Kraft Group, the company through which businessman Robert Kraft owns the Patriots and Revolution. The stadium was originally known as CMGI Field before the naming rights were bought by Gillette after the \u0022dot-com\u0022 bust. Although Gillette has since been acquired by Procter \u0026 Gamble, the stadium retains the Gillette name because P\u0026G has continued to use the Gillette brand name and because the Gillette company was founded in the Boston area. Gillette and the Patriots jointly announced in September 2010 that their partnership, which includes naming rights to the stadium, will extend through the 2031 season. Additionally, uBid (until April 2003 a wholly owned subsidiary of CMGI) as of 2009 continues to sponsor one of the main entrance gates to the stadium.\r\n\r\nThe Town of Foxborough approved plans for the stadium\u0027s construction on December 6, 1999, and work on the stadium began on March 24, 2000.

The Patriots play their home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough, Massachusetts. The team is part of the East Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). An original member of the American Football League (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in the 1970 merger of the two leagues. The team changed its name from the original Boston Patriots after relocating to Foxborough in 1971, although Foxborough is a suburb 22 miles (35 km) away from downtown Boston.\r\n\r\nSince the arrival of current head coach Bill Belichick in 2000, the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history. They are third in appearances in a Super Bowl with seven (the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys each have 8), and have the most appearances in the last 25 years. They have won all but two AFC East titles since 2001, and have not had a losing season since 2000. Before Belichick arrived, the Patriots had only notched consecutive playoff appearances twice in their history. Between 2001\u20132010, the Patriots set a record for most wins in a decade (121, different from conventionally bounded decades, 2000\u20132009, 1990\u20131999, etc.; this record references any ten-year stretch; second is the 1984\u20131993 San Francisco 49ers, with 120 wins); they broke their own record in 2011 (2002\u20132011 \u2013 123 wins), and again in 2012 (2003\u20132012 \u2013 126 wins \u2013 nearly 13 regular season wins per season). Between 2001 and 2005, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the Dallas Cowboys) to win three Super Bowls in four years (Super Bowl XXXVI, XXXVIII, and XXXIX), and the eighth (and most recent) to win consecutive Super Bowls. The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season. They were defeated again by the Giants in Super Bowl XLVI. During Belichick\u0027s tenure with the team along with quarterback Tom Brady, the Patriots have also compiled the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history, a 21-game streak from October 2003 \u2013 October 2004. The Patriots\u0027 rivalry with the New York Jets is considered one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL.\r\n\r\nPatriot fans rally in front of Boston City Hall following the Super Bowl XXXVIII championship\r\nThe Patriots have appeared in the Super Bowl seven times.

It primarily serves as the home venue for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL), and is also the home stadium for the Sugar Bowl and New Orleans Bowl in college football. Plans were drawn up in 1967 by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis and the building opened as the Louisiana Superdome in 1975. Its steel frame covers a 13-acre (5.3 ha) expanse and the 273-foot (83 m) dome is made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of 680 feet (210 m), making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world. It is adjacent to the Smoothie King Center.\r\n\r\nBecause of the building\u0027s size and location in one of the major tourist destinations of the United States, the Superdome routinely hosts major sporting events, including the Super Bowl, College Football Championship Game, and the Final Four in college basketball. The stadium was also the long-time home of the Tulane Green Wave football team of Tulane University until 2013 (when they returned on-campus at Yulman Stadium) and was the home venue of the New Orleans Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1975 until 1979.\r\n\r\nThe Superdome gained international attention of a different type in 2005 when it housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina. The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was closed for many months afterward. It was eventually decided the building would be fully refurbished and reopened in time for the Saints\u0027 2006 home opener on September 25.\r\n\r\nOn October 3, 2011, it was announced that German automaker Mercedes-Benz purchased naming rights to the stadium. The new name took effect on October 23, 2011. At that time, it was the third stadium that has naming rights from Mercedes-Benz (and first in the United States), after the Mercedes-Benz Arena, the stadium of Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart, in Stuttgart, Germany, and the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, China. Atlanta\u0027s Mercedes-Benz Stadium (home of the Falcons, who, like the Saints, play in the NFC South), which opened in 2017, became the fifth stadium (and second in the NFL) to bear the name of the German automaker.","strStadiumLocation":"New Orleans, Louisiana","intStadiumCapacity":"73208","strWebsite":"www.neworleanssaints.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com/neworleanssaints/","strTwitter":"twitter.com/Saints","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com/saints/?hl=en","strDescriptionEN":"The New Orleans Saints are a professional American football team based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Saints currently compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the league\u0027s National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The team was founded by John W. Mecom Jr., David Dixon and the city of New Orleans. The Saints began play in Tulane Stadium in 1967.\r\n\r\nThe name \u0022Saints\u0022 is an allusion to November 1 being All Saints Day in the Catholic faith, New Orleans\u0027 large Catholic population, and the spiritual \u0022When the Saints Go Marching In\u0022, which is strongly associated with New Orleans and often sung by fans at games. The franchise was founded on November 1, 1966. The team\u0027s primary colors are old gold and black; their logo is a simplified fleur-de-lis. They played their home games in Tulane Stadium through the 1974 NFL season. The following year, they moved to the new Louisiana Superdome (now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, since Mercedes-Benz has purchased the stadium\u0027s naming rights).\r\n\r\nFor most of their first 20 years, the Saints were barely competitive, only getting to .500 twice. In 1987, they finished 12\u20133\u2014their first-ever winning season\u2014and qualified for the NFL playoffs for the first time in franchise history, but lost to the Minnesota Vikings 44\u201310. The next season of 1988 ended with a 10\u20136 record, but no playoff berth. In the 2000 season, the Saints defeated the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams 31\u201328 to notch their first-ever playoff win.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast region. The Superdome was used as an emergency temporary shelter for displaced residents. The stadium suffered damage from the hurricane (notably from flooding and part of the roof being torn off as well as internal damage), and from lack of available facilities. The Saints were forced to play their first scheduled home game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (the Giants\u0027 home stadium); other home games were rescheduled at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas or Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During the season, it was rumored that Saints owner Tom Benson might deem the Superdome unusable and seek to legally void his contract and relocate the team to San Antonio, where he has business interests. Ultimately, however, the Superdome was repaired and renovated in time for the 2006 season at an estimated cost of US$185 million. The New Orleans Saints\u0027 first post-Katrina home game was an emotionally charged Monday Night Football game versus their division rival, the Atlanta Falcons. The Saints, under rookie head coach Sean Payton and new quarterback Drew Brees, defeated the Falcons 23\u20133, and went on to notch the second playoff win in franchise history.\r\n\r\nThe 2009 season was a historic one for the Saints. Winning a franchise-record 13 games, they qualified for Super Bowl XLIV and defeated the AFC champion Indianapolis Colts 31\u201317. To date, it is the only Super Bowl championship that they have won, and as it is the only Super Bowl the Saints have appeared in, they join the New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers as the only three NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 50 seasons, the Saints have compiled an overall record of 345\u2013436\u20135, with a regular season record of 338\u2013427\u20135 and a playoff record of 8\u201310.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"United States","strTeamBadge":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/nd46c71537821337.png","strTeamJersey":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/jersey/2018-134944-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/logo/xoc2wm1537821424.png","strTeamFanart1":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/vdi1sn1518119469.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/xla9kl1518119435.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/821qnt1518119534.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/rhy8h71518119596.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/banner/vxuquy1421524924.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com/channel/UCwuddf1JrodMlc5fYpVlrQA","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134935","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":"1","strTeam":"New York Giants","strTeamShort":"NYG","strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1925","strSport":"American Football","strLeague":"NFL","idLeague":"4391","strLeague2":null,"idLeague2":null,"strLeague3":null,"idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":null,"idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":null,"idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"Pat Shurmur","strStadium":"MetLife Stadium","strKeywords":"gmen bigblue","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/stadium/u09p8k1497890320.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"MetLife Stadium is a sports stadium located at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, United States.

The NJSEA continues to provide security and emergency medical services staff under contract to the stadium, as they have done in the past at Giants Stadium. The stadium opened as New Meadowlands Stadium on April 10, 2010, featuring the Big City Classic lacrosse event. In 2011, MetLife, an insurance company based in New York City, acquired the naming rights to the stadium. At a construction cost of approximately $1.6 billion, it is the most expensive stadium ever built and is the second\u2013largest stadium in the NFL in terms of seating capacity.\r\n\r\nAs Giants Stadium approached 30 years of age, it was becoming one of the older stadiums in the NFL. The Jets, who had been the lesser tenants in the Meadowlands, sought to have their own stadium built in Manhattan proper, the proposed West Side Stadium. Originally intended to be the 85,000-seat main stadium for New York\u0027s bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, it was designed to be downsized to 75,000 seats for the Jets. However, the West Side Stadium would have required significant public funding, which collapsed in 2005. The Jets then entered into a partnership with the Giants to build a new stadium in which the two teams would be equal partners.","strStadiumLocation":"East Rutherford, New Jersey","intStadiumCapacity":"82566","strWebsite":"WWW.Giants.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com/newyorkgiants/","strTwitter":"twitter.com/Giants","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com/nygiants/?hl=en","strDescriptionEN":"The New York Giants are a professional American football team located in the New York metropolitan area.

The Giants hold their summer training camp at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center at the Meadowlands Sports Complex.\r\n\r\nThe Giants were one of five teams that joined the NFL in 1925, and is the only one of that group still existing, as well as the league\u0027s longest-established team in the Northeastern United States. The team ranks third among all NFL franchises with eight NFL titles: four in the pre\u2013Super Bowl era (1927, 1934, 1938, 1956) and four since the advent of the Super Bowl (Super Bowls XXI (1986), XXV (1990), XLII (2007), and XLVI (2011)), along with more championship appearances than any other team, with 19 overall appearances. Their championship tally is surpassed only by the Green Bay Packers (13) and Chicago Bears (9).

Although the baseball team moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season, the football team continues to use \u0022New York Football Giants, Inc.\u0022 as its legal corporate name, and is often referred to by fans and sportscasters as the \u0022New York Football Giants\u0022. The team has also gained several nicknames, including \u0022Big Blue\u0022, the \u0022G-Men\u0022, and the \u0022Jints\u0022, an intentionally mangled contraction seen frequently in the New York Post and New York Daily News, originating from the baseball team when they were based in New York. Additionally the team as a whole is occasionally referred to as the \u0022Big Blue Wrecking Crew\u0022, even though this moniker primarily and originally refers to the Giants defensive unit during the 80s and early 90s.\r\n\r\nThe team\u0027s heated rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933, and has been called the best rivalry in the NFL in the 21st century.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"United States","strTeamBadge":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/vxppup1423669459.png","strTeamJersey":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/jersey/m11vuo1497889914.png","strTeamLogo":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/logo/82firn1497947834.png","strTeamFanart1":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/qi29ef1548364051.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/6frtj41548364064.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/cxbzq51548364077.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/40vnjj1548364090.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/banner/uuvuvt1421524686.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2FqoG8dN5EAz5WU3A0D7A","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134921","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"New York Jets","strTeamShort":"NYJ","strAlternate":"Gang Green","intFormedYear":"1959","strSport":"American Football","strLeague":"NFL","idLeague":"4391","strLeague2":null,"idLeague2":null,"strLeague3":null,"idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":null,"idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":null,"idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"Adam Gase","strStadium":"MetLife Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/stadium/nakash1552667314.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"MetLife Stadium is a sports stadium located at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, USA.

It has a seating capacity of 69,176. It is located in South Philadelphia on Pattison Avenue between 11th and South Darien streets, also alongside I-95 as part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Many locals refer to the stadium simply as \u0022The Linc\u0022.\r\n\r\nThe stadium opened on August 3, 2003 after two years of construction that began on May 7, 2001, replacing Veterans Stadium. While total seating capacity is similar to that of \u0022The Vet,\u0022 the new stadium contains double the number of luxury and wheelchair-accessible seats, along with more modern services. The field\u0027s construction included several light emitting diode (LED) video displays, as well as more than 624 feet (190 m) of LED ribbon boards.\r\n\r\nNaming rights were sold in June 2002 to Lincoln Financial Group, for a sum of $139.6 million over 21 years. Additional construction funding was raised from the sale of Stadium Builder\u0027s Licenses to Eagles season ticket holders.\r\n\r\nThe Army\u2013Navy football game is frequently played at the stadium due to Philadelphia being located halfway between both service academies, the stadium being able to house the large crowds in attendance, and the historic nature of the city. Temple University\u0027s Division I college football team also plays their home games at Lincoln Financial Field, paying the Eagles $1 million a year to do so. The Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer have played exhibition games here against high-profile international clubs when their stadium Talen Energy Stadium does not provide adequate seating. The stadium also plays host to several soccer games each year, and in the past (2005, 2006, 2013) it has played host to the NCAA lacrosse national championship.\r\n\r\nIn late spring of 2013, the Eagles announced that there will be some major upgrades to Lincoln Financial Field over the next 2 years. The total project estimate is valued at over $125 million. The upgrades included seating expansion, two new HD video boards, upgraded amenities, WiFi, and two new connecting bridges for upper levels. These upgrades were decided upon after research from season ticket holders, advisory boards, and fan focus groups. The majority of these changes, including WiFi (which will accommodate 45,000 users and have coverage over the entire stadium), were completed by the 2013 home opener.

Heinz Company, which purchased the naming rights in 2001. It hosted the 2011 NHL Winter Classic between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals on January 1, 2011.\r\n\r\nFunded in conjunction with PNC Park and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the $281 million ($374.3 million today) stadium stands along the Ohio River, on the Northside of Pittsburgh in the North Shore neighborhood. The stadium was designed with the city of Pittsburgh\u0027s history of steel production in mind, which led to the inclusion of 12,000 tons of steel into the design. Ground for the stadium was broken in June 1999 and the first football game was hosted in September 2001. The stadium\u0027s natural grass surface has been criticized throughout its history, but Steelers ownership has kept the grass after lobbying from players and coaches. Attendance for the 65,500 seat stadium has sold out for every Steelers home game, a streak which dates back to 1972 (a year before local telecasts of home games were permitted in the NFL). A collection of memorabilia from the Steelers and Panthers of the past can be found in the Great Hall.","strStadiumLocation":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","intStadiumCapacity":"65500","strWebsite":"www.steelers.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com/steelers/","strTwitter":"twitter.com/#!/steelers","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com/steelers/?hl=en","strDescriptionEN":"The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

They are members of the West division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Seahawks joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Seahawks are owned by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and are currently coached by Pete Carroll. Since 2002, the Seahawks have played their home games at CenturyLink Field (formerly Qwest Field), located south of downtown Seattle. The Seahawks previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976\u20131999) and Husky Stadium (1994, 2000\u20132001).\r\n\r\nThe Seahawks are the only NFL franchise based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and thus attract support from a wide geographical area, including Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and Alaska, as well as Canadian fans in British Columbia and Alberta.\r\n\r\nSeahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the \u002212th Man\u0022, \u002212th Fan\u0022, or \u002212s\u0022. The Seahawks\u0027 fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a then record-setting 137.6 dB.\r\n\r\nOver the years the Seahawks have had some notable players on the team, including Steve Largent, Dave Brown, Jim Zorn, Dave Krieg, John Randle, Kenny Easley, Curt Warner, Joe Nash, Brian Blades, Cortez Kennedy, Joey Galloway, Walter Jones, Steve Hutchinson, Shaun Alexander, Matt Hasselbeck and Marcus Trufant. Largent, Kennedy, and Moon have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as was Jones in 2014. Easley, Jones, Kennedy, Krieg, Largent, Warner, and Zorn have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with cornerback Dave Brown and defensive end Jacob Green.\r\n\r\nThe Seahawks have won nine division titles and three conference championships. They are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have appeared in three Super Bowls, including Super Bowl XLVIII where they defeated the Denver Broncos 43\u20138 to win their first NFL title. However, the Seahawks went on to lose Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots, 28\u201324. They are also the first, and to date only, post-merger expansion team in NFL history to advance to play in consecutive Super Bowls.\r\n\r\nAs per one of the agreed parts of the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to 28 teams. In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community leaders, announced its intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle. In June 1974, the NFL gave the city an expansion franchise. That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing of the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners for the consortium.\r\n\r\nIn March 1975, John Thompson, former Executive Director of the NFL Management Council and a former Washington Huskies executive, was hired as the general manager of the new team. The name Seattle Seahawks (\u0022Seahawk\u0022 is another name for Osprey) was selected on June 17, 1975 after a public naming contest which drew more than 20,000 entries and over 1,700 different names.\r\n\r\nThompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced on January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30\u201331, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league. The Seahawks were awarded the 2nd overall pick in the 1976 draft, a pick they used on defensive tackle Steve Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976 in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers in the then newly constructed Kingdome.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"United States","strTeamBadge":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/wwuqyr1421434817.png","strTeamJersey":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/jersey/2019-134949-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/logo/gnspli1552928452.png","strTeamFanart1":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/yvkycy1553199707.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/1rpx021553199722.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/p1qber1553199735.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/faapeh1553199749.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/banner/xsxwwu1421525034.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkFCRiMcOBeef8xcaqipmw","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134945","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Tampa Bay Buccaneers","strTeamShort":"TB","strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1976","strSport":"American Football","strLeague":"NFL","idLeague":"4391","strLeague2":null,"idLeague2":null,"strLeague3":null,"idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":null,"idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":null,"idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"Bruce Arians","strStadium":"Raymond James Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/stadium/vmmgtj1553271492.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Raymond James Stadium, also known as \u0022Ray Jay\u0022, is a multi-purpose football stadium located in Tampa, Florida.

The Bucs played their first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. After the season, the club switched conferences with the Seahawks and became a member of the NFC Central division. During the 2002 league realignment, the Bucs joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the Glazer family, and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.\r\n\r\nThe Buccaneers are the first post-merger expansion team to win a division title, win a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game; all three accomplishments occurred during the 1979 season. They are also the first team since the merger to complete a winning season when starting 10 or more rookies, which happened in the 2010 season. In 1976 and 1977, the Buccaneers lost their first 26 games. After a brief winning era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team suffered through 14 consecutive losing seasons.

The team competes in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the NFC East. The team plays its home games at FedExField in Landover, Maryland; its headquarters and training facility are at Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Ashburn, Virginia, and the Redskins Complex in Richmond, Virginia, respectively. The team has played more than 1,000 games since their founding in 1932, and are one of only five franchises in the NFL to record over 600 regular season and postseason wins, reaching that mark in 2015. They have won five NFL Championships (the latter three in Super Bowls), and have captured 14 divisional titles and five conference championships. The team was the first NFL franchise with an official marching band and the first with a fight song, \u0022Hail to the Redskins\u0022.\r\n\r\nThe team began play as the \u0022Braves\u0022 in Boston in 1932, changing its name to the \u0022Redskins\u0022 the following year. In 1937, the franchise relocated to Washington, D.C., where they have been based since. Washington won the 1937 and 1942 NFL championship games as well as Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. They have been league runner-up six times, losing the 1936, 1940, 1943, and 1945 title games, and Super Bowls VII and XVIII. With 24 postseason appearances, they have an overall postseason record of 23\u201318. Their three Super Bowl wins are tied with the Denver Broncos and Las Vegas Raiders, behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots (six each), San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys (five each), and the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants (four each).\r\n\r\nAll of the team\u0027s league titles were attained during two 10-year spans. From 1936 to 1945, the Redskins went to the NFL Championship six times, winning two of them. The second period lasted between 1982 and 1991 where the Redskins appeared in the postseason seven times, captured four Conference titles, and won three Super Bowls out of four appearances. They have also experienced failure in their history. The most notable period of general failure was from 1946 to 1970, during which the Redskins posted only four winning seasons and did not have a single postseason appearance. During this period, the Redskins went without a single winning season during the years 1956\u20131968. In 1961, the franchise posted their worst regular season record with a 1\u201312\u20131 showing. Since their last Super Bowl victory following the end of the 1991 season, they have only won the NFC East three times with just nine seasons with a winning record. In those, the team only made the postseason in six of them.\r\n\r\nThe Redskins name and logo drew controversy over its history, with many criticizing it as offensive to Native Americans. In wake of the George Floyd protests in 2020, the team announced it was retiring the Redskins name and would reveal a replacement at a later date, temporarily playing as the Washington Football Team that season. According to Forbes, Washington is valued at approximately US$3.1 billion, making them the fifth most valuable franchise in the NFL and the 14th-most valuable sports franchise globally.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"United States","strTeamBadge":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/badge/1m3mzp1595609069.png","strTeamJersey":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/jersey/ibncxq1486823316.png","strTeamLogo":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/logo/o2yknv1595609070.png","strTeamFanart1":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/lhcyvp1553611729.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/ayezgc1553611744.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/9iwqc61553611757.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/fanart/cyejtn1553611770.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/team/banner/qqqxqp1421524747.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com/channel/UC2a0ENbCZqIO5C1fWXGXZXA","strLocked":"unlocked"}]
